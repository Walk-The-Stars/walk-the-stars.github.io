        <p>Welcome to Walk the Stars! Walk The Stars is a space travel company that offers a unique experience for aspiring astronauts. They offer 3 packages for different budgets.

        <p>Before embarking on their journey, all aspiring astronauts will undergo a 4-week long training course and a refresher course before liftoff. Reservation sign-ups typically start 14 months before the journey and end 12 months before the journey. Walk The Stars takes safety seriously and ensures that the crew and staff are up to date on safety protocols and certifications and that the spacesuits are durable and tested.

        <p>Walk The Stars is a public company that was established in 2016 by a team of former aerospace engineers. With a goal to train future astronauts for space tourism, the company struggled financially until a group of investors saw its potential. Now, Walk The Stars generates over 2 billion dollars annually and continues to grow to meet the demands of society.</p>
