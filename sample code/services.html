          <p>Patient Connect is our premium service at HMU Communications. This service offers a video chat and meeting software for doctors all over the world.</p>
          <p>Your company can join the thousands of other medical firms, hospitals, clinics, and doctor’s offices that utilize telehealth with us. </p>
          <p>With Patient Connect, each patient’s medical history will be closely examined using Wellbo<sup>TM</sup>, our AI system, and a list of clinical centers will be recommended for them to choose from based on their time-zones, insurance provider, and health needs. </p>
          <p>Your firm can be easily found with tags, location, and specialties relevant to your company.</p>
          <p>After this step, Wellbo<sup>TM</sup> will analyze the patients’ past medical visits and add an appropriate time/date to the patient's and the doctor’s calendar. This can be easily changed at the patient’s request. </p>
          <p>The Patient Connect package also includes our Mediclex Video conferencing platform, which allows physicians to virtually diagnose issues and prescribe treatments. Finally, physicians can also use Mediplan (also included in the premium package) to schedule follow-up appointments.</p>

          <p>Mediclex is our basic video conferencing platform to promote telehealth in these times where face to face meetings are generally more unsafe and unreliable. </p>
          <p>Using Mediclex, you get a fully functional and standalone video conferencing platform with features made specifically for doctors and patients. </p>
          <p>These include being able to access the patients’ medical charts at any time, upload files in terms of past X-rays, MRIs, CT-scans, and more, along with patients uploading pictures of their problem spots to be analyzed. </p>
          <p>Additionally, there is a notes page where the professional can record information about the patient’s condition or treatment, and the patient can jot down actions that need to be taken for the future. </p>
          <p>Also, at any point during the meeting, additional people of the patient’s family or close circle can be invited and join the meeting. </p>
          <p>To keep our video conferences in high definition and high quality, we have multiple servers in the United Statee and Europe, as well as support in India, China, Japan and Australia. Our servers for Central Asian and Africa are still being established; we anticipate them to be fully functioning by 2023.</p>

          <p>The most basic of all of our solutions. Mediplan is a medical planning solution that can also be used as a standalone platform on your phone or computer.</p>
          <p>Here, your clinic can set up meeting dates, and use the inbuilt chat room functionalities to communicate with each other. </p>
          <p>Multiple smaller chat rooms under the main clinic chat can be set up for different teams, medical groups, and more. </p>
          <p>Patients can also use this platform; for example, they can schedule virtual visits based on your clinic’s published schedule.</p>
