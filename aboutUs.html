          <p>Walk The Stars was founded in 2016 by a group of former aerospace engineers who had a shared passion for
            space exploration. They are among the most experienced out there, having spent their entire careers working
            on some of the most complex and challenging projects in the aerospace industry. </p>
          <p>They were and still are determined to bring their expertise to use. The company started as a small,
            bootstrapped venture, with the founding team working day and night to turn their dream into a reality. </p>

        <h2>Faith in Our Vision</h2>
        
        <div class="event">
          <p>In the early days, Walk The Stars struggled to gain traction. The idea of space tourism was still a
            relatively new and scary concept, and many people were hesitant to invest in something so untested and
            uncertain. Many believed space tourism wouldn't ever succeed with how expensive and dangerous it seems. </p>
          <p> However, the team never lost faith in their vision, and they continued to work tirelessly to build the
            company and develop their training programs. Our dedicated workers have for the past couple of years
            promoted and informed many on the adventures of space tourism, answering all doubts and concerns the public
            may have. </p>

          <h2 >The Growth Spurt</h2>
            <p>Despite the challenges they faced, the company began to grow, and soon they were facing financial
              troubles. Space tourism can be extremely expensive, especially in the early stages as revenue is
              incredibly hard to obtain when still in the development stage. We seeked investments and with the quality
              of our progress at the time, we found that many investment groups were interested. This is a test commit from Ben's laptop</p>
            <p> A group of venture capitalists saw the potential in Walk The Stars, and they provided the capital needed
              to help the company take off. With the financial backing they obtained, the team was able to expand the
              business and develop more advanced training programs to accommodate the growing demand for space tourism.
            </p>
            <p>Today, Walk The Stars is a thriving company with over 2 billion dollars in yearly revenue. The company is
              dedicated to making the dream of space travel a reality for people all over the world. The company's
              founders are proud to have built a business that is helping to shape the future of space exploration, and
              they are eager to continue their mission for years to come.</p>
