          <p>Also referred to as telehealth or telemedicine in healthcare, medical telecommunications is healthcare delivered remotely using various forms of communication. This allows patients to consult a physician even when they are unable to meet them in person. This form of healthcare not only is convenient for patients looking for flexibility but can also be used by rural communities that may not have easy access to physical healthcare services.</p>
          <p>With the current circumstances surrounding the pandemic, the need for telecommunication in healthcare has dramatically increased. To minimize human interaction, many healthcare settings have opted to offer telehealth as an alternative to physically visiting a doctor. This ensures that patients receive the care they need, without high risk of transmitting or receiving disease through contact with others.</p>
          <p>Popular forms of consultations are the internet, video conferencing, or even asynchronous communication between the patient and their physician, such as text messaging. </p>

          <p>We use Artifical Technology (AI) to collect and analyze patientsâ€™ medical history. In minutes, users can receive referral to the appropriate healthcare offering from the broad range of choices presented.</p>
          <p>We also directly handle the billing process and payment. Not only are patients able to make payments immediately through us, but we can also submit claims to insurance carriers with little input needed from patients or physicians.</p>
          <p>Personalized care is very important to us, and we ensure that strong connections are made between patients and clinical teams based on their healthcare needs. Virtual care can be accessed from anywhere, on any device.</p>
          <p>We serve patients of all ages, and just as adults are referred to physicians based on their needs, children are connected with pediatricians.</p>
          <p>We connect consumers from all over the world, so to overcome language barriers, we use intelligence to match patients and physicians sharing a native language. </p>
