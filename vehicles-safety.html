    <h1>Vehicles and Safety</h1>
    <p>Walk The Stars is dedicated to the safety of everyone who boards their ships, no shortcuts, we are doing this the hard way. We protect the customer from the start of their reservation by not tracking data or banking information, as well as multi-level encryption for our servers. We ensure our crew and staff are up to date on safety protocols and certifications, as well as getting mandatory training once a year. We also ensure that our passenger’s spacesuits are durable and tested before liftoff through an extensive quality test. Our rockets are entered into extensive safety tests and are approved by NASA before liftoff, as well as receiving NASA’s approval for the overall design and functionality of the rocket. During the development of our rovers, the work that goes into developing the nuclear reactor is done by trained professionals who are well-equipped and experienced for the task. </p>
    <p>Worker safety is of utmost importance to Walk The Stars, and we ensure our employees are well taken care of. We provide our workers with extensive protection and a workplace environment approved by OSHA, as well as regular safety checks to ensure the safety of everyone involved. We accommodate our employees with extensive benefits that are customized to the occupation that they hold. For our basic coverage, we offer full dental and medical, 3 weeks of paid leave,  equipment needed to work remotely, as well as discounts on things such as online subscriptions.</p>
